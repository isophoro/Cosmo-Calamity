:gf:Ah! I remember now...
:yukichitalk:Oh? What is it, friend?
:bfquestion:Beep?
:gf:It was about...
:gfconfused:Hm...
:gfconfused:Unpaid debts or something...
:gfconfused:or probably something to do with a space conquest? I'm really not thinking correctly here...
:yukichitalk2:Unpaid debts? Space conquest? That's funny, I don't remember anything like that... If I did, it must've been a LONG time ago.
:yukichitalk:Do you evade your taxes?
:gfconfused:What?
:yukichitalk2:What?
:bfquestion:Boop...?
:gfnervoussmile:Ah, nevermind... It must've slipped my mind again.
:gfconfused:Can I have a moment...? Uh...
:yukichitalk:Yukichi?
:gfnervoussmile:Yeah, give us a moment, Yukichi.
:gfneutral:* She pulls you into a whisper...
:gfguilt:BF, I DO remember... But I just don't want to be the bearer of the bad news...
:bfquestion:Beep boop...?
:gfpensive:It might bring us into more trouble than we've already got, we should get out of here before we make anybody upset.
:bfguilt:Skdoo bah bep?
:gfguilt:My dad told me about this planet long ago, he said he'd "make it as he envisioned". But I think that's just a way of saying he's gonna conquer this planet and use it for something else...
:bfpensive:Boop...
:gfnervoussmile:Let's just... fake it until we make it home, okay? We'll get out of here, we could probably just lie to the old man when we get home. Besides, I love music.
:bfdetermined:Bap!
:gfneutral:* She pulls you out of the whisper
:gf:Hey Yukichi! Let's sing another song!
:bfhype:Beep ska doo!
:yukichihappy:Another song? Why didn't you say so?
